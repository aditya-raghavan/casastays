CASA STAYS GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CODING 

Hey guys, I have created a repository called casa stays on github. You can clone this to your PC. 
I have created the signup and signin pages. 

So we are gonna be working on different pages on our websites, lets have some common paradigms like fonts and stuff we'll follow while designing our stuff. 


We'll store our style sheets in css folder. 
Java scripts in js folder. 
All our pages will be outside these folders.(You'll get it when you clone the repo). 

I have created a page called skeleton.html which has the basic layout for all our pages. Run that and see once. 
Skeleton page has its respective style sheet in css folder. 

So lets say you are creating a home page. 
What you have to do is, copy the code from skeleton.html and paste it in a new file called home.html and edit that. 
The basic styles will be included already like fonts and stuff. Include skeleton.css in all your pages so that you'll have the common 
styles. PLEASE DO NOT EDIT IN THE SKELETON.HTML OR THE SKELETON.CSS file.

I have used a color code for casa stays. So please include the color touch wherever you can. 

Also, I thought it would be easier, instead of editing pradyum's older project, take code from it and paste it in your page and 
edit it to your needs. But feel free to work according to your comfort, but please make sure your page is stored in casastays repo. 

1. RUN SKELETON.HTML FIRST
2. THEN, RUN SIGNUP.HTML 
3. YOU CAN CLICK ON SIGNIN IN THE NAVBAR AND SEE THE SIGN IN PAGE. 
4. PLEASE OPEN THE HTML CODES AND READ THE COMMENTS AND STUFF. 
5. ALSO, PLEASE READ THROUGH THE CODES SO THAT WE'LL BE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER'S STUFF. 


MOST IMPORTANT: PLEASE USE COMMENTS IN YOUR PAGES SO THAT WE'LL UNDERSTAND THE CODES EASIER. 

These are just basic instructions from my side I have assumed for now, If you guys feel the need the change anything, 
please don't hesitate to discuss.
